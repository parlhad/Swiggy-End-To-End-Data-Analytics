# Swiggy-End-To-End-Data-Analytics

Designed a Swiggy-themed Power BI dashboard to analyze sales, user activity, and restaurant performance. Used Power Query and DAX to clean data, create KPIs, and deliver interactive visual insights.



# 📊 Business Problem Statement
Swiggy operates in a highly competitive and fast-paced food delivery market where customer loyalty is low and operational costs are high. The business faces five core challenges that this project aims to solve:

Revenue Volatility: Frequent and unpredictable fluctuations in monthly revenue make long-term financial planning and scaling difficult.

High Customer Churn: A significant portion of the customer base stops using the platform after only a few orders, leading to a "leaky bucket" problem where acquisition costs never break even.

Heavy Revenue Dependency: The business relies disproportionately on a small segment of high-value customers, creating a high risk if these "power users" leave the platform.

Uneven Geographic Performance: Sharp differences in purchasing behavior between different cities make it difficult to apply a "one-size-fits-all" marketing strategy.

Ineffective Retention Targeting: Without predictive data, the marketing team cannot distinguish between a user who is just busy and a user who is about to leave the platform forever.

# Core Objective
The goal of this project is to transition Swiggy from a reactive business (reacting after customers leave) to a proactive business. By leveraging SQL for deep-dive analysis and Machine Learning for predictive modeling, we aim to identify churn patterns and build an automated system to intervene with targeted retention strategies before the customer is lost.

## 📘  Executive Summary
This project is a comprehensive end-to-end data analytics pipeline built on a multi-table Swiggy-style food delivery dataset. 

**The objective was to:**
* **Understand** revenue behavior and volatility.
* **Analyze** customer purchasing patterns and the 80/20 rule.
* **Identify** and quantify churn behavior (87.76% churn rate).
* **Build** a predictive model using XGBoost and Random Forest.
* **Deploy** the model as a production-ready web application via Render.

- `Average Order Value = [Total Revenue] / DISTINCTCOUNT(Orders[Order ID])`
- `Order Count = COUNTROWS(Orders)`
- `Average Delivery Time = AVERAGE(Orders[Delivery Time])`
- `User Activity = DISTINCTCOUNT(Orders[User ID])`
- `Rating Category = SWITCH(TRUE(), ... )` *(for custom rating groups)*

---

## 🔄 Power Query (Data Transformation)

- Removed duplicates and nulls
- Split columns (City-State if applicable)
- Data type formatting
- Date and time standardization
- Merged multiple tables using relationships (1:M)

---

## 🔎 Q2: Is Revenue Distribution Skewed?

```python
df['Sales_amount'].skew()
df['Sales_amount'].kurtosis()
```

### 📌 Output

- Skewness: 18.36
- Kurtosis: 569.97

### 💡 Insights

- Extremely heavy-tailed distribution.
- Few large premium orders drive revenue.
- Business is vulnerable to loss of high spenders.

---

## 🔎 Q3: Which Cities Are Dominant?

Grouped revenue by City:

Premium Cities:
- Sirsi
- Tirupati
- Srikakulam

Stable Cities:
- Kovilpatti
- Orai
- Osmanabad

### 💡 Decision

- Retention strategy in premium cities.
- Volume scaling in mass-market cities.

---

## 🔎 Q4: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

```python
clv = df.groupby('User_id')['Sales_amount'].sum()
clv.describe()
```

### 📌 Output

- Mean CLV: ₹12,484.74
- Median CLV: ₹1,921.00

### 💡 Insights

- 20% customers generate ~80% revenue.
- Large gap between mean and median confirms inequality.

---

## 🔎 Q5: Age vs Spending Correlation

```python
df[['Age','Sales_amount']].corr()
```

### 📌 Output

- Correlation ≈ 0

### 💡 Insight

Age is NOT predictive of spending behavior.

---

## 🔎 Q6: Rating vs Revenue

```python
df[['Rating_count_numeric','Sales_amount']].corr()
```

### 📌 Output

- Correlation = -0.0019

### 💡 Insight

Higher ratings do not guarantee higher revenue.

---

## 🔎 Q7: Order Frequency Distribution

```python
orders_per_user = df.groupby('User_id').size()
orders_per_user.describe()
```

### 📌 Output

- Mean Orders: 2.4
- Median Orders: 2

### 💡 Insight

Most customers order 1–2 times and churn.

---

## 🔎 Q8: Recency vs Revenue

```python
correlation = df[['Recency_days','Total_Revenue']].corr()
```

### 📌 Output

- Correlation = -0.0673

### 💡 Insight

Weak negative relationship.

---

# 🚨 Phase 3: Churn Analysis & RFM

---

## 🔎 Q9: Active vs Churned Users

Churn defined as 90-day inactivity.

### 📌 Output

Active Users:
- Avg Orders: 2.42
- Avg Revenue: ₹16,414

Churned Users:
- Avg Orders: 1.83
- Avg Revenue: ₹11,936

### 💡 Insight

Higher frequency & spending reduce churn risk.

---

## 🔎 Q10: T-Test (Statistical Significance)

```python
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
```

### 📌 Output

- P-value = 0.0

### 💡 Insight

Behavior differences between active and churned users are statistically significant.

---

## 🔎 Q11: Feature Correlation with Churn

Top Predictor:

- Recency (+0.516)

Negative Predictors:
- Total Orders
- Total Revenue

### 💡 Insight

Recency is strongest churn driver.

---

## 🔎 Q12: RFM Segmentation

Segments Created:

| Segment | % |
|----------|------|
| Champions | ~15% |
| Loyal | ~40% |
| Potential Loyalists | ~28% |
| At Risk | ~17% |

### 💡 Strategic Insight

- 55% are strong base.
- 28% growth opportunity.
- 17% reactivation focus.

---

## 🔎 Q13: Overall Churn Rate

```python
churn_rate = churned_users / total_users * 100
```

### 📌 Output

- Churn Rate: 87.76%
- Active Users: 9,457
- Churned Users: 67,778

### 💡 Insight

Extremely high churn — retention is priority.

# 🤖 Phase 4: Machine Learning Model

---

## Model Comparison (ROC AUC)

| Model | ROC AUC |
|---------|---------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.66 |
| Random Forest | 0.85 |
| XGBoost | 0.72 |

🏆 Best Model: Random Forest (Notebook Phase)

Later production optimization selected Random Forest (AUC 0.91 after feature engineering refinement).

---

## Feature Importance

1. Recency
2. Total Orders
3. Avg Order Value
4. Total Revenue

---

## Final Model Saved

```python
import joblib
joblib.dump(model, 'random_forest_churn.pkl')
```

# 🎯 Final Business Decisions

## 🔴 High Risk
- 30% discount coupon
- Free delivery
- Push notification

## 🟠 Medium Risk
- 15% discount
- Personalized recommendations

## 🟢 Low Risk
- Swiggy One promotion
- Reward points
- Referral incentives

---

# 🚀 . Deployment Architecture
* **Backend:** Flask
* **Server:** Gunicorn
* **Environment:** Docker Containerization
* **Cloud Hosting:** Render
* **Live URL:** [https://swiggy-end-to-end-data-analytics.onrender.com/](https://swiggy-end-to-end-data-analytics.onrender.com/)

---

## 🎯  Business Recommendations
* **🔴 High Risk (At Risk):** Deploy 30% discount coupons and free delivery via push notifications.
* **🟠 Medium Risk (Potential Loyalists):** Personalized recommendations and 15% limited-time offers.
* **🟢 Low Risk (Champions):** Promote "Swiggy One" and referral reward points.

---

## 🏆  Final Strategic Conclusion
The data proves that Swiggy’s main challenge is **retention**, not acquisition. Revenue depends heavily on a small 20% segment. By utilizing the **XGBoost churn model**, Swiggy can transition from reactive to proactive marketing, significantly stabilizing monthly revenue.

---
